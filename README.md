- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thomas Renfroe.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in lots of stuff, but as it relates to tech, I am interested in coding, bots, AI, and SciFi. Non-tech interests include history, philosophy, politics, the military, Warhammer 40k, gaming, and shooting.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in the UT BootCamp. I started coding by modding computer games and developed an interest.

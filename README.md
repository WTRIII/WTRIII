- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m William Renfroe. Check out my portfolio here: https://wtriii.github.io/react-portfolio-wtriii/.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in lots of stuff, but as it relates to tech, I am interested in coding, bots, AI, and SciFi. Non-tech interests include history, philosophy, politics, military operations, Warhammer 40k, gaming, fitness, and shooting.

- ðŸŒ± I graduated the UT coding bootcamp in December and am currently looking for employment as a junior web dev. I started coding by modding computer games and developed an interest.
